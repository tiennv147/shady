### Facts
+ StarCraft 1 used a peer-to-peer Lockstep model, while StarCraft 2 is Client-Server, but still a Lockstep model. [Starcraft2 Netgames.pdf](http://choongsoo.info/docs/starcraft2.netgames12.pdf).
+ Supreme Commander 1 uses Lockstep [Synchronous RTS Engines and a Tale of Desyncs](http://forrestthewoods.com/synchronous-rts-engines-and-a-tale-of-desyncs/) while newer games like Planetary Annihilation use Client-Server [Client-Server Network Model](http://planetaryannihilation.gamepedia.com/Client-server_network_model).
+ Dota 1 was running on the Warcraft 3 engine which used Lockstep, but when Valve rewrote the Source engine it uses Client-Server [Extending Node-dota2](https://blog.rjackson.me/extending-node-dota2/).
+ In the FPS corner DOOM used Lockstep but Quake used Client-Server, Lockstep did not live long with FPS games at all.
MMOs never used Lockstep because its not not feasible for that many players.
