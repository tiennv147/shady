Shady is an easy to use, fast, scalable, distributed game server framework for Node.js. It provides a core network architecture and a series of tools and libraries that can help developers eliminate boring duplicate work for common underlying logic. The goal of Shady is to improve development efficiency by eliminating the need to spend time on repetitious network related programming.

While developed originally for games, Shady is not game specific and could be used for any real-time web application. The scalability and flexibility of Shady makes it usable as a general-purpose distributed real-time application development framework.
